# Week 1,2:
- finished micro controller selection research
- Switched decision to rp2040 platform
- ordered off of temu
- started designing plane in Fusion 360
- Goals this week:
  * research basic arduino circuits
  * start learning fundamentals of circuit python
# Week 3:
- designed version 1 concept of a plane
  * ![plane_concept](images/IMG_1916.jpg)
- also designed a 3d printed servo mount
  * ![servo_mount](images/IMG_1917.jpg)
- Next week, I plan on playing around with the micro controller and learning how to program it with a python based library

# Week 4:
- microcontroller came a bit late and my soldering station is not ready
- this week, I finished Tasks.md list, with potential for more to be added once details are specified
- drove to Chicago to pick up parts for the project
- next week, I plan to start soldering and redoing the designs
  * the original planned plane design was not viable for stable flight
 
 # Week 5,6:
 - finished soldering servo pins to board and crimping jumper cables
 - Goals:
   * flash the microcontroller with CircuitPython or MicroPython
   * finish a wiring diagram to connect an LED

# Week 7:
- finished flashing CircuitPython firmware
- accomplished basic control of built in LED on board
- Goals:
  * process a PWM input and power the board from an RC receiver
  * toggle the LED based on the PWM input
